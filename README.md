# Manyfold

Manyfold (pronounced "manifold", and previously known as VanDAM)
is a digital asset manager, specifically designed for 3D print
files. Create a library pointing at your files on disk, and it will scan for
models and parts. It assumes that any folders containing STL or OBJ files are
models, and the files within them are parts. You can then view the files easily
through your browser!

As this is a very young project, there are a few rough edges! This video from DBTech
explains them pretty nicely though, then the specific details are below:

## Running in Docker

You can run the latest release in docker by using the image
`ghcr.io/manyfold3d/manyfold:latest`. The app also needs a PostgreSQL and Redis
database to operate.

The docker image supports `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64`
architectures, so you should be able to run it on a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or an M1
Mac.

You can run all the dependencies in one go using `docker-compose`:

1. Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and edit the paths,
   secret key, and database password

2. Run `docker-compose up`

   This might fail the first time it's run due to race conditions in setting up
   the database.

3. Open Manyfold at <http://localhost:3214>

4. Add a library

   Remember the path mappings in the Docker Compose file? In
   `docker-compose.example.yml` the libraries at `/path/to/your/libraries` in
   your file system would be available at `/libraries` in the app.

## Development

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.x
- Bundler 2.x
- Node.js 16.x
- Yarn >= 1.22
- Foreman or [another Procfile runner](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman#ports)
- [libarchive](https://github.com/chef/ffi-libarchive#installation) (for upload support)
- [glfw3](https://github.com/danini-the-panini/mittsu#installation) (for model analysis & manipulation)

### Usage

```
bundle install
yarn install
bundle exec rake db:migrate:with_data
bin/dev
```

The server will then be running at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>

### How to run the test suite

`bundle exec rake`
