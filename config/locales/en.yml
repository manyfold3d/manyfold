      negation: To exclude terms, use "not", "!", or "-".
      parentheses: Group terms with parentheses for more complex logic combinations.
      path: Search within model folder paths by explicitly specifying it; use `~` for a partial match.

      simple: By default, search will find models that match all terms.
      specific_fields: You can look for terms in a few specific fields. Use "~" to match part of the field; "=" will try to match the whole thing. Model descriptions and library names are only searched if you explicitly specify the fields.
