      missing:
        title: Folder not found
    model:
      empty:
        description: This model contains no files. Either delete it, or find where its files went!
        title: No files
      missing:
        description: The folder for this model is missing on disk; either delete it, or find where it went!
        title: Folder not found
      nesting:
        description: The model folder on disk contains other models. You may wish to merge them into this one, or move them out.
        title: Contains other models
        warning: Bulk merging moves all files from the models above into this one, and removes them. File metadata is preserved, but any model metadata will be lost!
      no_3d_model:
        description: This model contains no 3D files. That is unlikely to be correct.
        title: No 3D files in model
      no_creator:
        description: We don't know who made this model; add a creator to help with cataloguing!
        title: Model is not attributed to a creator
      no_image:
        description: This model contains no image files. Adding one might make it easier to browse.
        title: No image files in model
      no_license:
        description: This model doesn't have a specified license. Adding one will make it clearer if and how it can be shared.
        title: Model has no license information
      no_links:
        description: This model has no links to other sources. If it's also available elsewhere, you might want to add a link to it.
        title: Model has no source links
      no_tags:
        description: This model has not been tagged, which makes it harder to find. Add some tags to help!
        title: Model does not have any tags
    model_file:
      duplicate:
        description: This file is duplicated in other models. You may wish to remove some.
        title: Duplicated file
      inefficient:
        description: This file is in %{note}, an inefficient file format. Consider converting it to a binary format such as 3MF to save disk space.
        title: Inefficient format
      inside_out:
        description: This mesh looks like its faces might be pointed the wrong way, which could cause print errors. Repair it in a 3d modeling tool such as MeshLab or 3D Builder.
        title: Inside-out mesh
      missing:
        description: This file is missing on disk; either delete it, or find where it went!
        title: File not found
      non_manifold:
        description: This mesh appears to be non-manifold, meaning it has holes or has some faces backwards, and may cause errors when printed. Repair it in a 3d modeling tool such as MeshLab or 3D Builder.
        title: Non-manifold mesh
