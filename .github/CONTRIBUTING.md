Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make sure the old and new tests both pass!

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/compare/).

We try to at least comment on pull requests within a few days (and normally much
quicker). We may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Check that your code passes our [linter](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=readme-ov-file#coding-standards).
* Write a [good commit message](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).

## Generative AI policy

We are highly unlikely to review or accept AI-generated or "vibe coded" PRs; our time is very limited, and we need to know that *you* understand exactly what the code is doing and why, so that we can review it effectively with you.

In addition, AI-generated code is likely incompatible with our license and CLA, as the author cannot guarantee that it does not reproduce copyrighted or FOSS-incompatible material. See the [NLNet generative AI policy](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/policies/generativeAI/) for more explanation of this and how it could even jeopardise our funding.

If you really *must* submit AI-generated code, you will need to include prompt provenance including the model used, dates and full content of prompts, and the unedited LLM output. Again, see [the NLNet generative AI policy](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/policies/generativeAI/#transparency), and the article [Track Prompt Provenance in Version Control](https://medium.com/@psluaces/track-prompt-provenance-in-version-control-8746e2bad3c2) by Pablo Santos Luaces.
