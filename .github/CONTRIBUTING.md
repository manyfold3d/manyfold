# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=coc-ov-file#coc-ov-file).

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/manyfold.git

Get the app running locally by following these [instructions](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=readme-ov-file#running-locally):

Then make sure the tests pass:

    rake

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make sure the old and new tests both pass!

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/compare/).

We try to at least comment on pull requests within a few days (and normally much
quicker). We may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Sign our simple [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/manyfold3d/manyfold) agreeing to license your code as MIT
* Write tests.
* Check that your code passes our [linter](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=readme-ov-file#coding-standards).
* Write a [good commit message](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).
* We are highly unlikely to review or accept AI-generated "vibe coded" PRs; our time is very limited, and we need to know that *you* understand exactly what the code is doing and why, so that we can review it effectively.
